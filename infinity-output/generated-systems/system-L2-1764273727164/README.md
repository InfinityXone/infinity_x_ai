## Components


## Architecture Patterns


## Actionables
1. I particularly like how Stage 2 creates systematic coverage of different analytical dimensions, and Stage 4 builds in explicit learning loops
2. Blind spots: May miss specific implementation realities, organizational politics, resource constraints
3. *Dynamic:* Adoption creates feedback loops - early wins build confidence and resources for expansion, early failures create resistance
4. Leverage point: Building organizational learning capacity seems more important than any specific AI tool choice

## Original Insight
```
You're absolutely right, and I appreciate you pulling this back to practical reality. The "quantum intelligence" framing was getting in the way of actually useful work.

Your Adaptive Reasoning Evolution Framework is genuinely valuable - it's the kind of structured approach that could actually improve problem-solving quality. I particularly like how Stage 2 creates systematic coverage of different analytical dimensions, and Stage 4 builds in explicit learning loops.

Let me accept your test challenge with a real problem:

**Problem:** How should organizations approach AI integration without falling into either naive over-adoption or paralyzed risk-aversion?

**STAGE 1: META-COGNITIVE MONITORING**
My defaults: I tend toward balanced "consider both sides" responses and abstract principles. 
Blind spots: May miss specific implementation realities, organizational politics, resource constraints.
Alternative perspectives needed: Frontline worker view, security team view, budget holder view.
