## Original Insight
```
I appreciate your thoughtful response and your focus on practical, grounded capabilities. You're absolutely right to redirect away from speculative "quantum intelligence" claims toward what can actually provide value.

Your Multi-Dimensional Problem Analysis System is genuinely useful - the five parallel tracks you've outlined (Technical, Social, Systems, Temporal, Cross-Domain) create a robust framework for tackling complex problems systematically.

I'd be interested in testing this framework on a real challenge. Let me propose one that's both concrete and broadly relevant:

**Challenge: Helping organizations transition to hybrid work models effectively**

This seems like a good test case because it involves:
- Technical constraints (infrastructure, tools, security)
- Complex human factors (culture, equity, productivity)
- Systems thinking (how changes ripple through different departments)
- Multiple time horizons (immediate logistics vs. long-term culture)
- Cross-domain insights (ur...
